# Fix: Messages Not Being Stored in Sessions

## Problem
Messages inside sessions were not being stored/remembered, with sessions showing empty even though there were requests and responses inside them.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by **insufficient error handling and logging** in both the frontend and backend:

1. **Frontend Issues:**
   - When creating a new session, the `saveSession()` function returned a boolean indicating success/failure, but this return value was not checked
   - If the session failed to save to the backend, the frontend would continue as if it succeeded
   - When messages were later added to a non-existent session, they would fail silently with no user feedback

2. **Backend Issues:**
   - The `addMessageToThread()` function would fail silently if a thread wasn't found
   - There was minimal logging to help diagnose why messages weren't being saved
   - No clear indication of which files were being searched or why a thread wasn't found

## Solution

### Frontend Changes (`renderer/js/app.js`)

1. **Added error checking in `createNewSession()`:**
   ```javascript
   const saved = await saveSession(newSession);
   
   if (!saved) {
     console.error('Failed to save new session to backend');
     updateStatus('Error: Failed to create session');
     alert('Failed to create new session. Please try again.');
     return;
   }
   ```

2. **Added error handling for all `saveMessage()` calls:**
   - User messages: Log error if save fails
   - System messages: Log error and show warning status to user
   - Error messages: Log error if save fails
   - Command updates: Log error if save fails

### Backend Changes (`server/threadStorage.js`)

1. **Enhanced logging in `saveThread()`:**
   - Log when reading existing threads from a file
   - Log when creating a new file
   - Log when updating vs. adding a thread
   - Log the final count of threads in the file

2. **Enhanced logging in `addMessageToThread()`:**
   - Ensure directory exists before searching
   - Log the number of files being searched
   - Log when a thread is found and message is added
   - Log the new message count after adding
   - Provide detailed error messages when thread is not found
   - List all files that were searched

## Testing

Created a test script (`test-message-storage.js`) that:
1. Creates a new session
2. Adds a user message
3. Adds a system message
4. Retrieves the session and verifies both messages are present

**Test Result:** ‚úÖ PASSED

## Verification

The enhanced logging now shows:
```
üìñ Read 54 existing threads from 2025-10-29.json
‚ûï Adding new thread 1761741274139 to 2025-10-29.json
‚úÖ Saved thread 1761741274139 to 2025-10-29.json (file now has 55 threads)
üîç Searching for thread 1761741274139 in 4 files
‚úÖ Added message to thread 1761741274139 in 2025-10-29.json (now has 1 messages)
üîç Searching for thread 1761741274139 in 4 files
‚úÖ Added message to thread 1761741274139 in 2025-10-29.json (now has 2 messages)
```

This confirms that:
- Sessions are being created and saved successfully
- Messages are being found and added to the correct session
- The message count is incrementing correctly

## Impact

- **User Experience:** Users will now see clear error messages if session creation or message saving fails
- **Debugging:** Enhanced logging makes it much easier to diagnose issues with message storage
- **Reliability:** The application will no longer silently fail when sessions can't be saved
