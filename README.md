# ü§ñ AI Agent Tester

An Electron-based desktop application for macOS that provides an inbox-style interface for testing AI agents with command execution capabilities. Built with Electron, Express.js, and Node.js.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Inbox-Style Interface**: Gmail-like layout with session list and message view
- **Command Execution**: Safely execute whitelisted shell commands
- **Modern UI**: Dark theme with macOS-native styling
- **Real-time Updates**: Live status indicators and command output
- **Security First**: Whitelisted commands to prevent arbitrary code execution

## üìã Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your Mac:

- **Node.js** (v16 or higher) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **macOS** (10.13 or higher recommended)

To check if you have Node.js and npm installed:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Navigate to the Project Directory

```bash
cd ai-agent-tester-app-mac
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install all required npm packages:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install:
- Electron (for the desktop app)
- Express (for the backend API)
- CORS (for cross-origin requests)

### 3. Run the Application

Start the app in development mode:

```bash
npm start
```

Or with developer tools open:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will:
1. Start the Express server on `http://localhost:3000`
2. Launch the Electron window
3. Load the inbox interface

## üîß How It Works

### Architecture

1. **Electron Main Process** (`main.js`): 
   - Creates the application window
   - Starts the Express server
   - Manages app lifecycle

2. **Express Backend** (`server/app.js`):
   - Provides REST API endpoints
   - Handles command execution
   - Manages session data

3. **Frontend** (`renderer/`):
   - Displays inbox-style interface
   - Communicates with Express API
   - Renders sessions and messages

### API Endpoints

- `GET /api/health` - Check API status
- `GET /api/threads` - Get all sessions
- `GET /api/threads/:id` - Get specific session details
- `GET /api/commands` - Get available commands
- `POST /api/execute` - Execute a whitelisted command
- `POST /api/execute-custom` - Execute custom command (use with caution)

## üé® Using the Application

### Viewing Sessions

1. Launch the app with `npm start`
2. The left sidebar shows a list of conversation sessions
3. Click any session to view its messages in the main panel

### Executing Commands

1. Select a session (or use the input area directly)
2. Choose a command from the dropdown menu
3. Click the "‚ñ∂Ô∏è Execute" button
4. View the command output in the text area

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter` - Send message
- Standard macOS shortcuts work (Cmd+C, Cmd+V, etc.)

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Running in Development Mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

This opens the app with DevTools enabled for debugging.

### Modifying the UI

- Edit `renderer/index.html` for structure
- Edit `renderer/css/styles.css` for styling
- Edit `renderer/js/app.js` for frontend logic

### Modifying the Backend

- Edit `server/app.js` to add new API endpoints or commands

### Hot Reload

Currently, you need to restart the app to see changes. For auto-reload during development, consider installing:

```bash
npm install --save-dev electron-reload
```

## üì¶ Building for Distribution

The app is configured with **electron-builder** to create professional macOS installers (.dmg files).

### Build Commands

```bash
# Build for macOS (creates DMG installers for both Intel and Apple Silicon)
npm run build

# Build DMG only
npm run build:dmg

# Build without packaging (for testing)
npm run build:dir
```

### What Gets Built

Running `npm run build` will create:

- `dist/AI Agent Tester-1.0.0-x64.dmg` - For Intel Macs
- `dist/AI Agent Tester-1.0.0-arm64.dmg` - For Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) Macs

### Installing the DMG

1. Double-click the `.dmg` file
2. Drag "AI Agent Tester" to the Applications folder
3. Launch from Applications or Spotlight

### Code Signing (Optional)

For public distribution, you should sign the app with an Apple Developer certificate:

1. Get an Apple Developer account ($99/year)
2. Create a "Developer ID Application" certificate
3. Add to `package.json`:

```json
"build": {
  "mac": {
    "identity": "Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAM_ID)"
  }
}
```

Without code signing, users will see a security warning on first launch (they can bypass it by right-clicking and selecting "Open").

### Build Configuration

The build configuration is in `package.json` under the `"build"` field. Key settings:

- **appId**: `com.aiagent.tester` - Unique identifier for your app
- **icon**: `build/icon.icns` - App icon (auto-generated from PNG)
- **target**: Builds for both `x64` (Intel) and `arm64` (Apple Silicon)
- **output**: `dist/` directory

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use

If port 3000 is already in use, edit `main.js` and change:

```javascript
const PORT = 3000; // Change to another port like 3001
```

### App Won't Start

1. Delete `node_modules` and reinstall:
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules
   npm install
   ```

2. Check Node.js version:
   ```bash
   node --version  # Should be v16 or higher
   ```

### Commands Not Executing

1. Check the terminal/console for error messages
2. Verify the command exists in `ALLOWED_COMMANDS`
3. Check file permissions if accessing files

## üéØ Famous Quotes MCP Server

This project includes a sample **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** server that provides access to famous quotes. This is a great example of how to create a simple MCP server in a single Node.js file.

The MCP server is located at the root level as `famous-quotes-mcp-server.js` - a standalone file with no dependencies, making it easy to use and deploy.

### What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standard protocol that allows AI assistants (like Claude, Gemini, etc.) to interact with external tools and data sources. The MCP server exposes tools that the AI can call to retrieve information.

### Features

The Famous Quotes MCP server provides four tools:

1. **search_quotes** - Search quotes by keyword or author
2. **list_all_quotes** - List all 20 famous quotes in the database
3. **get_random_quote** - Get a random quote
4. **list_authors** - List all unique authors

### Running the MCP Server

#### Installation

No installation needed! The server is a standalone Node.js file with no dependencies.

#### Running Standalone

You can test the server directly from the project root:

```bash
node famous-quotes-mcp-server.js
```

The server communicates via stdio (standard input/output), so it will wait for JSON-RPC messages. You'll see console logs when tools are called.

### Adding to Google Gemini Desktop App

To use this MCP server with the Google Gemini desktop app, you need to add it to your MCP settings configuration.

#### Step 1: Locate Your MCP Settings File

The Gemini desktop app stores MCP server configurations in:

```
~/Library/Application Support/Google/Gemini Desktop/mcp_settings.json
```

If this file doesn't exist, create it.

#### Step 2: Add the Server Configuration

Edit `mcp_settings.json` and add the Famous Quotes server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "famous-quotes": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/your-path-to/ai-agent-tester/famous-quotes-mcp-server.js"
      ],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}

// so if you are Wouter Smet developing locally the path would be something like:
// "/Users/wouter.smet/Projects/ai-agent-tester/famous-quotes-mcp-server.js"
```

**Important**: Replace `your-path-to/ai-agent-tester` with the actual absolute path to your project directory. So something like `/Users/wouter.smet/Projects/ai-agent-tester/famous-quotes-mcp-server.js`

#### Step 3: Restart Gemini Desktop App

1. Quit the Gemini Desktop app completely
2. Relaunch it
3. The MCP server should now be available

#### Step 4: Test It

In the Gemini chat, try asking:

- "Can you search for quotes about love?"
- "Show me quotes by Steve Jobs"
- "Give me a random quote"
- "List all authors in the quotes database"

Gemini will automatically call the appropriate MCP tools to retrieve the information.

### Viewing Server Logs

The MCP server logs all tool calls to stderr. To see these logs:

1. Check the Gemini Desktop app's console/logs
2. Or run the server standalone and pipe input to it for testing

Example log output:
```
[MCP Server] Famous Quotes MCP server running on stdio
[MCP Server] Tool called: search_quotes
[MCP Server] Arguments: {
  "keyword": "love"
}
[MCP Server] Response: {
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "Found 1 quote(s):\n\n1. \"In this life we cannot do great things. We can only do small things with great love.\"\n   ‚Äî Mother Teresa"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Testing the Server Manually

You can test the MCP server directly by sending JSON-RPC requests to it. The server communicates via stdio (standard input/output).

#### Running the Test Script

We've included a test script that demonstrates all the server's capabilities:

```bash
node test-mcp-server.js
```

This will run through all available tools and show you the responses.

#### Manual Testing with JSON-RPC

You can also send requests manually. Start the server:

```bash
node famous-quotes-mcp-server.js
```

Then send JSON-RPC requests via stdin. Here are some examples:

**1. List Available Tools:**
```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list","params":{}}
```

**2. Get a Random Quote:**
```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"get_random_quote","arguments":{}}}
```

**3. Search Quotes by Keyword:**
```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":3,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"search_quotes","arguments":{"keyword":"love"}}}
```

**4. Search Quotes by Author:**
```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":4,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"search_quotes","arguments":{"author":"Steve Jobs"}}}
```

**5. Search by Both Keyword and Author:**
```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":5,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"search_quotes","arguments":{"keyword":"great","author":"Steve Jobs"}}}
```

**6. List All Quotes:**
```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":6,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"list_all_quotes","arguments":{}}}
```

**7. List All Authors:**
```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":7,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"list_authors","arguments":{}}}
```

#### Example Response Format

All tool calls return responses in this format:

```json
{
  "result": {
    "content": [
      {
        "type": "text",
        "text": "\"The only way to do great work is to love what you do.\"\n‚Äî Steve Jobs"
      }
    ]
  },
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 2
}
```

#### Using Echo for Quick Testing

You can use `echo` to send a single request:

```bash
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"get_random_quote","arguments":{}}}' | node famous-quotes-mcp-server.js
```

This will output the server logs to stderr and the JSON response to stdout.

### Customizing the Server

The quotes are hardcoded in the `QUOTES` array in `famous-quotes-mcp-server.js`. You can:

- Add more quotes
- Add new tools (e.g., filter by category, date, etc.)
- Connect to a real database
- Add more sophisticated search capabilities

This is a great starting point for learning how to build MCP servers!
